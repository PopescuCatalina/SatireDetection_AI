In this solution, the focus is on satire detection in two datasets, FreSaDa , a French satire dataset, for multi-domain satire detection, which is composed of 11,570 articles from the news domain, and the SaRoCo dataset, which is a dataset for detecting satire in Romanian News containing 55,608 news articles from multiple real and satirical news sources, of which 27,980 are regular and 27,628 satirical news. It provides data in csv format, in three files following train/validation/test splits.
In the next part, three classification methods CamemBERT, Ro-BERT tuned Romanian BERT) and Bert will be taken to compare them in detecting satire on original and translated texts. The French dataset will be translated to English using the language transformers because
there are more resources in English and Bert is much better prepared and we will proceed accordingly with the second. In the final part, a method of applying the logistic regression model on the concatenation of the weights of both data sets was tried.
